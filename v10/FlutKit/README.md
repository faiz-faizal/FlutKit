## Project Setup

In order to set up the project, please follow below steps:

### Flutter setup

1. Upgrade flutter to newest version
```

```

2. Install package dependencies:
```
flutter pub get
```

3. Run the project by running command:
```
flutter run
```

4. Use one of these commands to build the project:

```

5. If any issue (run the below command to troubleshoot):

```


#### Google map setup

1. To use Google Maps in your Flutter app, you need to configure an API project with the [Google Maps Platform](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/), following both the [Maps SDK for Android's Get API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/get-api-key), and [Maps SDK for iOS' Get API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/get-api-key) processes. With API keys in hand, carry out the following steps to configure both Android and iOS applications.
2. To add an API key to the Android app, edit the ```AndroidManifest.xml``` file in ```android/app/src/main```. Add a single meta-data entry containing the API key created in the previous step.
3. To add an API key to the iOS app, edit the ```AppDelegate.swift``` file in ```ios/Runner```. Unlike Android, adding an API key on iOS requires changes to the source code of the Runner app. The AppDelegate is the core singleton that is part of the app initialization process.
